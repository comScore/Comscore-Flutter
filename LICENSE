This SDK is intended for use only by entities providing data for inclusion in the Services, and for such entities' internal business
operations only, and for no other purpose. Additionally, this Software License Agreement (the “Agreement”) governs use of the
SDK by you, and the entity on whose behalf you are downloading the SDK (“you”). BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR
OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SDK, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO
BE BOUND BY THE AGREEMENT. **_IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, YOU MAY NOT USE THE SDK AND NO DATA SHOULD BE
TRANSMITTED TO COMSCORE._**

Accordingly, you acknowledge and agree as follows:

agree that all data transmitted to Comscore is subject to the terms and conditions of the **Data Sharing Agreement** (DSA) at
https://direct.comscore.com/Signup/Signup.aspx, and use of the SDK and/or facilitation of the transmission of data to Comscore
shall be deemed your agreement to the DSA without further action. If you are prohibited under applicable law from using the

regulations related to export controls, foreign corrupt practices, and data privacy and compliance) in connection with your use of
the SDK. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you represent and warrant that the SDK will not be shipped, transferred
or exported into any country or used in any manner prohibited by the United States Export Administration Act or any other export

consistent with this Agreement is permitted, however, you may have broader rights to use that Third Party Software under the
applicable Third Party Terms and nothing in this Agreement is intended to impose further restrictions on your use of the Third

8. **WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.** THE SDK, COMSCORE MATERIALS AND ALL ASSOCIATED
DOCUMENTATION, LIBRARIES, AND CODE ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, COMSCORE DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND
CONDITIONS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, QUALITY,
RESULTS, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. COMSCORE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WITH
RESPECT TO THE ACCURACY OR FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SDK, AND WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCURACY, VALIDITY,
OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY INFORMATION OR FEATURES AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SDK, OR THE QUALITY OR
CONSISTENCY OF THE SDK OR RESULTS OBTAINED THROUGH ITS USE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL
COMSCORE BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES
WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SDK, EVEN IF COMSCORE HAS BEEN ADVISED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY
LIMITED REMEDY. IN NO EVENT WILL COMSCORE'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TERMS EXCEED THE GREATER OF AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU FOR THE SDK, IF ANY, OR $50USD.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION
OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO
YOU. IN SUCH AN EVENT THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS WILL BE ENFORCED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.
9. INDEMNITY. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Comscore and its affiliates, officers, directors, suppliers, licensors, and
other customers harmless from and against any and all liability and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by such
parties, in connection with or arising out of your use or misuse of the SDK and Comscore Materials, or your violation of this
Agreement, any applicable law or regulation.
10. GOVERNING LAW; VENUE. Any claim relating to the SDK or Service shall be governed by the laws of New York, without
regard to conflict of laws provisions. Disputes arising under this shall be resolved in, and subject to the sole and exclusive
jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and you hereby agree this exclusive venue
and submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts in the Commonwealth of Virginia.
11. MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Comscore, and supersedes any and all prior
agreements, negotiations, or other communications between you and Comscore, whether oral or written, with respect to the SDK
or Comscore Materials, and cannot be modified except in writing signed by both parties. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then: (a) such provision shall be deemed reformed to the extent strictly
necessary to render such provision valid and enforceable, or if not capable of such reformation shall be deemed severed from
this Agreement; and (b) the validity and enforceability of all of the other provisions hereof, shall in no way be affected or impaired
thereby. You may not assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of Comscore, whether expressly or by operation of
law, including in connection with a merger or change of control, and any such attempted assignment shall be void and of no
effect. Comscore may assign this Agreement without restriction and without any notice to you. Subject to the foregoing, this
Agreement shall be binding on the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. You acknowledge and
understand that if Comscore is unable to provide the SDK, or if its functionality is impaired, as a result of a force majeure event
Comscore will not be in breach of this Agreement. A force majeure event means any event beyond the control of Comscore. The
failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, a right, power or remedy provided in this Agreement or by law shall not constitute a
waiver of that right, power or remedy. Comscore's waiver of any obligation or breach of this Agreement shall not operate as a
waiver of any other obligation or subsequent breach of the Agreement. The English language version of this Agreement shall be
the official and controlling version, and any translation provided is solely for convenience. The SDK is a “Commercial Item” as
that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of “Commercial Computer Software” and “Commercial Computer Software
Documentation.” If and to the extent the SDK is supplied to or purchased by or on behalf of a United States government entity or
an entity licensing the SDK for or on behalf of a United States government entity, the SDK is licensed (a) only as a Commercial
Item and (b) with only those rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions of this agreement.
